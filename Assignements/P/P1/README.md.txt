this file contains the modified Huffman.java file. TestCompression.java and the files needed to realise the test (test.txt, abcefString.txt, ACTGhandout.txt, genes.txt,greeneggsandham.txt,midsummer.txt)
and (don.jpg and .DS_Store).
the output.txt files contains the results of my test realised with the command (java TestCompression T tests.txt > output.txt)
the net package contains all the .java files needed to realise the tests.

the results (in output.txt) are similar to ResultsExcepted.txt (contained also in the file) (but in the output we can see the different tables at each phase)

the contents of testfiles were copied directly in the Assignement file to avoid some errors.
